There are two short cuts provided in the PEBBLE folder as alternatives that can be used to start the PEBBLE program from the desktop

You can drag which ever icon you prefer to the desk top

If you have the PEBBLE directory (folder) in a location other than the root (main) directory of you C: hard drive you will need to edit the shortcut as follows:

1. right click the shortcut icon and select Properties.

2. you will see two entries as:
	Target:   C:\PEBBLE\PEBBLE.html
	Start in: C:\PEBBLE

3. Change these two entries to point to the locaton where you ahve installed the PEBBLE software.
    For example if you have PEBBLE  located on your E: drive in a directory named  PEBBLE V2.4D
    Then the entries should be changed to:
	Target: "E:\PEBBLE V2.4D\PEBBLE.html"
	Start in: "E:\PEBBLE V2.4D"

You can rename the shortcut and even the main PEBBLE directory to whatever names you you like
BUT the sub directories (folders) within PEBBLE must always have the same names.
